# Object-Detector
Design a CNN model that predict the object in the image using CIFAR-10 dataset

# **Architectur**<br />

create 4 layers with padding tha, and relu as
activation function after each 2 layer there is a max pool layer, than two fully connected layers
with relu and softmax activation functions.

<br /> The accuracy of last epoch was good <br />
**Accuracy reached train is 0.7891000000190734** <br />
**Accuracy reached Val is 0.7971** <br />
